0 -> T = Time
1 -> dt = Time increase per loop
2 -> .txt file to read from (ONLY planets.txt, atom.txt, renegade.txt and illusion.txt TESTED and working).

T -> max time (default 157788000.0, as double)
dt -> update time each loop (default 25000.0, also double)


Increase 0 (T) for max time looping.
Increase 1 (dt) for increased speed.
