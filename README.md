0 -> T = Time <br />
1 -> dt = Time increase per loop <br /> 
2 -> .txt file to read from (ONLY planets.txt, atom.txt, renegade.txt and illusion.txt TESTED and working). <br />

T -> max time (default 157788000.0, as double) <br />
dt -> update time each loop (default 25000.0, also double) <br />


Increase 0 (T) for max time looping. <br />
Increase 1 (dt) for increased speed.
